# YOLO Node

## Overview

To facilitate object detection tasks, PeekingDuck offers a family of “You Only Look Once,” or YOLO models consisting of YOLOv4 and YOLOv4-tiny. The YOLOv4 was developed by [Bochkovskiy _et al._](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934.pdf), while the YOLOv4-tiny was developed by [Jiang _et al._](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04244.pdf). Both models were trained using the MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset and are capable of detecting objects from [80 categories](#Class-IDs-and-names). The YOLO node uses the YOLOv4-tiny by default and can be changed to using YOLOv4, with other configurable options, by following the steps illustrated [here](#Configurable-parameters).

### Input and outputs

The YOLO node's input is an image stored as a three-dimensional NumPy array. For live or recorded videos, the input will be a single video frame per inference.

The YOLO node's outputs are the bounding boxes' coordinates, classes name and confidence scores of the detected objects. These results are stored in a dictionary and can be accessed using the dictionary keys shown below. Detailed descriptions of the outputs are in the following sub-section.

| Name of output              | Dictionary key |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Bounding boxes' coordinates | bboxes         |
| Classes name                | bbox_labels    |
| Confidence score            | bbox_scores    |

#### Bounding boxes' coordinates - "bboxes"

A N by 4 NumPy array, where N represents the number of detected bounding boxes and 4 represents the four coordinates of each bounding box. The four coordinates correspond to:

- x1: top left x-coordinate
- y1: top left y-coordinate
- x2: bottom right x-coordinate
- y2: bottom right y-coordinate

The order of the bounding boxes' coordinates corresponds to the order of "bbox_labels" and "bbox_scores".

```python
outputs['bboxes'] = np.array([[x1, y1, x2, y2],
                              ...,
                              [x1, y1, x2, y2]])

# example

outputs['bboxes'] = np.array([[0.30856234 0.12405036 0.8565467  1.]])
```

#### Classes name - "bbox_labels"

A NumPy array of the detected objects' classes name. The order of the classes name corresponds to the order of "bboxes" and "bbox_scores".

```python
outputs['bbox_labels'] = np.array([str, str, ..., str])

# example

outputs['bbox_labels'] = np.array(['person'])
```

#### Confidence scores - "bbox_scores"

A NumPy array of the confidence scores of the predicted objects. The order of the confidence scores corresponds to the order of "bboxes" and "bbox_labels". Note that the score is between 0 and 1.

```python
outputs['bbox_scores'] = np.array([float, float, ..., float])

# example

outputs['bbox_scores'] = np.array([0.34761652])
```

## Configurable parameters

The full list of configurable parameters for the YOLO node are listed in [yolo.yml](https://github.com/aimakerspace/PeekingDuck/blob/dev/peekingduck/configs/model/yolo.yml). To change the default parameters, follow the instructions to configure node behaviour in the [main readme](https://github.com/aimakerspace/PeekingDuck). Below is an example of how the YOLO node is configured to use YOLOv4 for 'person', 'aeroplane' and 'cup' detection.

```yaml
# Example: Configure YOLO node to detect 'person', 'aeroplane' and 'cup' using YOLOv4
nodes:
  - input.live
  - model.yolo:
      model_type: v4
      detect_ids: [0, 4, 41]
  - draw.bbox
  - output.screen
```

The table shown below is a list of commonly adjusted parameters for the YOLO node.
